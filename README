DESCRIPTION
    Tries to connect to all instances specified your sqlhosts file and sends
    the status to your Xymon/Hobbit Server. Each server will be sent a
    single test called database which is red if any single database is down.
    Status page shows status of all db instances on that host.

    You must install DBI and DBD::Informix for this module to work.

CONSTRUCTOR
            my $informix = Xymon::Monitor::Informix->new({.....});

    All parameters are optional and are listed below:

            CONTIME - connection timeout (default 5)
            CONTRY - connection tries (default 1)
            INFORMIXDIR - informix directory ($INFORMIXDIR) (default /informix)
            LD_LIBRARY_PATH - default (/informix/lib:/informix/lib/esql/)
            HOBBITHOME - hobbit/xymon dir (default home/hobbit/client/)

    The script listed in the synopsis is all you need to send updates to
    Xymon/Hobbit, however you will also need to add the script to your
    hobbitlaunch.cfg file.

    A group of lines like the following should work.

            [informix]
            ENVFILE /home/hobbit/server/etc/hobbitserver.cfg
            NEEDS hobbitd
            CMD /home/hobbit/server/ext/ifxcheck.pl
            LOGFILE $BBSERVERLOGS/informix.log
            INTERVAL 30

    The installation script asks you where you want to install the included
    test script. It should go in your hobbit ext directory.

METHODS
            check() - checks all found instances from sqlhosts and sends status
            to master hobbit server.
